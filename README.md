# Obscura

**Obscura** is a simple and secure web-based encryption tool for encrypting and decrypting messages using AES-GCM. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it enables users to securely encode text using a passphrase and decode it only with the correct key.

[Live Demo](https://ryanmpierson.com/arcade/obscura)

## Features

- AES-256 GCM encryption in the browser
- Password-based key derivation using PBKDF2
- Toggle visibility for passphrases
- Responsive and modern UI
- No backend required — everything runs client-side

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/obscura.git
cd obscura
````

### Open in Browser

## Security

Obscura uses:

* **AES-GCM (256-bit)** for authenticated encryption
* **PBKDF2** with SHA-256 and 100,000 iterations for key derivation
* A unique **12-byte IV** for every encryption operation

All operations are performed in-browser using the Web Crypto API. No data is sent to any server.
